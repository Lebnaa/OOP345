Reflections 

All STL function used in this workshop:

accumulate	-	To sum up the number of deaths and cases in the word and per country if one is provided 
for_each	-	To display all Covids in the collection and to accumulate cases and deaths.
sort		- 	To sort the collection based on received criteria, like country.
any_of		-	For function inCollection to indicate wheather there exists a country with a specified variant with more than the amount of deaths specified.
copy_if		-	To copy from collection to a new list any covid statistic with more deaths than provided.
transform	-	To change the severity in each Covid in the collection to the corresponding one depending on number of deaths.



If I wrote the loops myself I would have to come up with a lot more logic than exists, 
like sort, the code would also be a lot slower than the provided algorithms.using algorithms provided saved a lot of time coming up with logic, and are much more efficient.


I would redesign it so that an unsigned integer is received in place of a string, for example, 
passing col.sort(0) would sort the collection based on the first member of Covid, which is country, if a number would be passed larger than number of member variables in Covid, an exception would be thrown that such a field does not exist.
