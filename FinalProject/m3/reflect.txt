I don't have any specific comments. Throughout the semester I did learn a lot anf loved the way thing were thought. I think it would have been better if we had coding questions in th quizzes, it would help a lot in terms of getting ready exams and be prepared it anf that way we could also test we know becuase workshops we have access to a lot of help online, doesn't really count as testing myself as i much i know, pracicing of course. 

Quiz coding woudld help because we learn things step by step and testing what we laerned and we know what we need to work on and exams wont be as much difficult because we know what we need to work on and on what topic we need practice more.

Thank you for everything.
